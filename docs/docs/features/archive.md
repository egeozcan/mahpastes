# Archive

Keep important clips separate from your active workspace. The archive provides long-term storage for clips you want to save but don't need cluttering your main gallery.

## Why Use Archive?

- **Declutter**: Keep your main gallery focused on active work
- **Protect**: Archived clips never expire (auto-delete is disabled)
- **Organize**: Separate reference material from transient clips
- **Find Later**: Search works in both gallery and archive

## Archiving Clips

### Single Clip

1. Hover over the clip
2. Click the archive icon (box with arrow)
3. The clip moves to Archive

### Multiple Clips

1. Hold <span className="keyboard-key">Shift</span> and click to select multiple clips
2. Click **Archive All** in the bulk action bar
3. All selected clips move to Archive

## Viewing the Archive

Click the **Archive** tab at the top of the window.

The archive view shows:
- All archived clips in a grid
- Same display format as main gallery
- Search and filter work here too

## Unarchiving

### Single Clip

1. Open the Archive tab
2. Click the archive icon on the clip (same icon, reverse action)
3. The clip returns to the main gallery

### Multiple Clips

1. Select multiple archived clips
2. Click **Unarchive All** in the bulk action bar
3. All selected clips return to gallery

## Archive Behavior

### No Expiration

When you archive a clip:
- Any existing expiration is **removed**
- The clip becomes permanent
- It won't be auto-deleted

This protects important content from accidental deletion.

### All Features Available

Archived clips support all operations:
- Copy to clipboard
- Copy path
- Edit (images and text)
- Download
- Delete

### Search Across Both

The search bar filters:
- Main gallery (when in gallery view)
- Archive (when in archive view)

## Use Cases

### Reference Material

Store frequently-needed content:
- Code snippets
- Configuration templates
- Image assets
- API response examples

### Important Screenshots

Preserve key screenshots:
- Bug reports
- Design mockups
- Meeting notes
- Documentation

### Templates

Keep reusable content:
- Email templates
- Code boilerplate
- Common configurations
- Frequently-used text

## Workflow Examples

### Developer Workflow

1. Paste code snippets during development
2. Archive useful patterns for reuse
3. Main gallery stays clean for active work
4. Search archive when you need that snippet again

### Designer Workflow

1. Capture design variations
2. Archive approved versions
3. Compare against archive for consistency
4. Keep working designs in main gallery

### Writer Workflow

1. Collect research and references
2. Archive important sources
3. Work with active materials in gallery
4. Return to archive for citations

## Tips

### When to Archive

Archive content that:
- You'll need again later
- Represents completed work
- Serves as reference material
- Is too valuable to lose

### When Not to Archive

Keep in main gallery:
- Active working materials
- Temporary transfers
- Content with short-term relevance

### Regular Maintenance

1. Review main gallery periodically
2. Archive valuable clips
3. Delete unused clips
4. Keep both views manageable

## Best Practices

### Naming

If possible, provide meaningful filenames when importing:
- `api-response-template.json`
- `login-button-screenshot.png`
- `sql-query-users.txt`

Good names make archive search more effective.

### Organization

Think of archive as long-term storage:
- Main gallery = desktop (active work)
- Archive = filing cabinet (reference)

### Cleanup

Even archive needs occasional cleanup:
- Review old archived clips
- Delete truly outdated content
- Keep archive searchable and relevant
